This project presents a comparative financial analysis of two entertainment giants, Walt Disney and Universal Studios, focusing on their risk profiles and market sensitivity through the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). By analyzing beta values, the project explores how Disneyâ€™s diversified operations contribute to its lower risk compared to Universal's greater reliance on Comcast and the entertainment sector's volatility. The project also discusses the challenges of financial data sourcing and processing using Excel and suggests that a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis could provide deeper insights into the intrinsic value and investment potential of both companies.
